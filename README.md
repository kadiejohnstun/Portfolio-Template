## Overview of Apprenticeship
- **Host Company**: Verizon

## Portfolio Introduction
- Who you are: I am David Johnstun, but most call me Kadie, pronounced like the girls name. I am first and foremost a husband and a father to four amazing children. I am a retired Marine Combat Veteran and an avid Volleyball player and coach. I call home Hawaii, and miss it everyday. I try to spread the spirit of Aloha everyday with those I come in contact with, especially by telling amazingly corny Dad jokes.
- Why you do what you do: I work in the Cyber industry to challenge myself and to provide for my family. 
- The teams you have worked on: I currenly work on the Internal Threat Operations (ITO) team. I would tell you what I do but then I would have to...get fired.
- Your areas of interest: I love pushing myself and self-improving. Not only just in work but in being a better person. Jim Rohn says: "Learn to work hard on the job and you will make a living. Learn to work hard on yourself, and you will make a fortune."

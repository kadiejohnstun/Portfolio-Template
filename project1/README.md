## Project #1
Give a high-level overview of the project purpose
- (*Situation*) Describe the application and why you created this program
-  Kharmalina, Sharee, Rita and I created an inventory application for an assignment to show off our skills in coding up to this point.
- (*Task*) Describe the overall structure of your application and the design process prior to building the program
-  Our application was web based and allowed a user to go on to navigate through an online store. Each item needed a name, description, price, category and an image. The user needed to be able to view each individual item. As a team we were able to add and delete items to the site. And as a challenge we were able to add a login and registration page as well.
